 Golf & Country Club
 - Nigeria
The School Of Hardknocks SOHK Nigeria Makes A Historic Tour
To IBB Golf Course Towards Promoting The Game Of Golf
In Nigeria.

The School of Hardknocks, SOHK Nigeria recorded its presence at the IBB Golf Course
located within the vicinity of the Presidential Villa, Aso Drive. It was indeed an amazing
experience and captivating moments with thrills of excitement among members of the
SOHK Golf Team. The recorded time of the team visit and arrival at the IBB Golf was
exactly 3 pm January Friday 13th, 2023. The CEO of SOHK Nigeria Dr. Jerry Akubo led
his Golf enthusiast Team to visit the most impressive Golf in the continent of Africa.

Upon arrival, the SOHK Nigeria team was warmingly received by the General Manager of
IBB International Golf & Country Club, Mr. Kalip B. Jauwi who was exceptionally delighted
to identify with the objectives of The School Of Hardknocks. In his welcome address, Mr.
Kalip explained that the IBB Golf was established in 1991 by General Ibrahim Badamosi
Banbagida and its 18 Whole standard Golf Course and amazing features was designed
by Julius Berger.

Mr. Kalip further explained that playing Golf reveals
your personality showing whether you're disciplined,
honest, truthful, articulative, and respectful to other
people. He also noted that the game of Golf requires a
very high level of concentration without any atom of
distraction. Mr. Kalip also described the wildlife attributes of the IBB Golf Course that it incubates an ecosystem of Crocodiles, Fishes, Birds, Snakes Monkeys,
and Antelopes which attracts Golfers to the unique
IBB Golf Club.

- Mr. Kalip, General Manager, IBB Golf Course
“Your mental alertness is key to any
successful strike of a Golf Ball”. 

The entire SOHK Golf Team was led by The IBB Tour Guide Mr. Maxwell, on a convoy of
the four expensive IBB Golf Carts of the club. In the tour session, he identified various
locations such as the Green, the Bunker, The Stroke Index Board, The Fairway, The
T-Box, The Par, etc. It was indeed exciting to see Golfers stroking perfectly their balls
along the fairways as we toured the entire 125 Hectares of the IBB 18 Golf Course within
4 hours. The experience will forever be an antidote to anxiety, stress, and crime inclinations for the SOHK Team.
Touring the IBB 125 Hectares and the 18 Whole Standard Golf Course
Undoubtedly, the CEO of SOHK Nigeria Dr. Jerry Akubo in his quest and passion to drive
the objectives of the NGO reiterated his relentless commitment to using Sports to fight
crime and is currently promoting Golf through strategic engagement with relevant
stakeholders like IBB Golf Club and setting up Mobile Golf avenues to get various people
attracted to golf.

It will no doubt allow some the opportunity to have access to Golf and enjoy it outdoors
and get a little exercise at the same time. For others, it is a chance to get away from the
stress and strain of their daily routine and find a location to learn how to become professional golfers. Also, it will instill and inspire others to enjoy the social aspect of golf—as a
game that people of different ages, backgrounds, and abilities can play together, as
there is no violence attached to Golf Sports as a means to fight and eradicate Crime in
Nigeria.
