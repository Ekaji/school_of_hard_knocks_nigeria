The School Of Hardknocks Nigeria Makes A Historic Tour To IBB
Golf Course Towards Promoting The Game Of Golf In Nigeria.

### ARRIVAL OF SOHK TEAM AT THE IBB GOLF CLUB
The School of Hardknocks Nigeria recorded its presence at the IBB
Golf Course. Located in the vicinity of the Presidential Villa at Aso
Drive, the facility spans 125 hectares. It was indeed an amazing and
captivating experience as the CEO of SOHK Nigeria Dr. Jerry Akubo
led his Team to visit the most impressive Golf Course in the African
continent.

Upon arrival, the SOHK Nigeria team was warmly received by the
General Manager of IBB International Golf & Country Club, Mr.
Kalip B. Jauwi who was exceptionally delighted to identify with the
objectives of The School Of Hardknocks. In his welcome address,
Mr. Kalip explained that the IBB Golf was established in 1991 by
General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida and its 18 Whole standard
Golf Course and amazing features were designed by Julius Berger.
The entire SOHK Golf Team was led by The IBB Tour Guide Mr. Maxwell,
on a convoy of the four expensive IBB Golf Carts of the club. In the tour
session, he identified various locations such as the Green, the Bunker,
The Stroke Index Board, The Fairway, The T-Box, The Par, etc. It was
indeed exciting to see Golfers perfectly stroking their balls along the
fairways as they toured the entire 125 Hectares of the IBB Golf Course
within 4 hours. The experience will forever be an antidote to anxiety, and
stress to any visitor.

### IMPORTANCE OF GOLF
Mr. Kalip further explained that playing Golf reveals your personality
showing whether you're disciplined, honest, truthful, articulative, and
respectful to other people. He also noted that the game of Golf requires
a very high level of concentration without any atom of distraction. In his
words, your mental alertness is key to any successful strike of a golf Ball.
Mr. Kalip also described the wildlife attributes of the IBB Golf Course, it
incubates an ecosystem of Crocodiles, Fishes, Birds, Snakes, Monkeys,
and Antelopes which attracts Golfers to the unique IBB Golf Club.

### USING SPORTS TO FIGHT CRIME
The CEO of SOHK Nigeria, Dr. Jerry Akubo in his quest and passion
to drive the objectives of the NGO reiterated his relentless
commitment to using Sports to fight crime and is currently
promoting Golf through strategic engagement with relevant
stakeholders like IBB Golf Club and setting up Mobile Golf avenues
to get various people attracted to golf.
It will no doubt allow some the opportunity to have access to Golf
and enjoy it outdoors and get a little exercise at the same time. For
others, it is a chance to get away from the stress and strain of their
daily routine and find a location to learn how to become
professional golfers. Also, it will instill and inspire others to enjoy
the social aspect of golfâ€”as a game that people of different ages,
backgrounds and abilities can play together, as there is no violence
attached to Golf Sports as a means to fight and eradicate Crime in
Nigeria.
