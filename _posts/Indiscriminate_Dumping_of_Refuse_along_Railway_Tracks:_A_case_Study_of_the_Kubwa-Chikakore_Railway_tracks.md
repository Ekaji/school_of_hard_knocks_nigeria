Cleanliness of the railway tracks is an important aspect that can enhance the image of the railway service as well as affect its functionality in the long run. Our Case Study in this article is the railway track that runs from the Kubwa train station in Abuja to the Rigasa train station in Kaduna State.

Walking along the rail line that runs through Kubwa and Chikakore settlements, one can vividly see the unsanitary conditions in these areas. Sadly, it has become some kind of Toilet-Facility for all manners of persons from the surrounding communities as well as from passers-by.

A major challenge, however, which could become a threat to the health of the inhabitants of the area is the indiscriminate Dumping of Refuse and Open Defecation.

The areas along the railway tracks are kept very unclean. Children from the surrounding communities are often seen loitering along the passage areas of the railway tracks and may require the blaring horns of the train to get them out of the way.

A visit to an area in the Chikakore settlement reveals a situation that calls for immediate attention. Inhabitants of the area can be seen depositing heaps of refuse beside the railway tracks which of course results in polluting the air which is detrimental to human health.

If this remains uncontrolled, it could lead to health hazards and will eventually become a life-threatening environmental factor due to poor sanitation.

Furthermore, poor maintenance of the railway tracks, in the long run, may affect its function, because, if the situation continues, the heaps of refuse may extend onto the railway tracks.

This situation remains a cause for worry and a lingering eyesore for some well-meaning residents, as many cannot walk past these areas without noticing these hazards.

The environmental walk championed by [TAC Africa](https://tacafrica.org) in collaboration with Mr. [Tidy-Nigeria](http://mrtidynigeria.com/) will create awareness in these communities and help the residents to see a more proper way of disposing of waste rather than close to the railway lines.

The environmental campaign is geared towards cleaner and safer railway corridors along the Kubwa-Chikakore-Railway-Tracks and helps the residents to realize that a clean railway corridor is a social responsibility as it improves the overall health and well-being of their families and community.
