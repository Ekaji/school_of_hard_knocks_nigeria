There is undoubtedly no less expensive ways to
spend a day, than on a golf course. For a golfer,
nothing quite equals the pleasurable sensation of
hitting the ball with a well placed swing and
seeing it fly down the fairway onto the green. 



The
peaceful atmosphere, the aroma of the
fresh-mowed grass, the manicured landscape, and
the company of friends are all pleasant fringe
benefits that enhance the business at hand - the
pursuit of the perfect swing.
This perfectly describes the scenario that
unravelled the amazing moments of the Entou- rage that accompanied the CEO, TAC Africa, Dr.
Jerry Akubo to the IBB Gold Course on 5th Sunday
November 2022. It was indeed a unique and
thrilling experience. 

The entire team went round
the 18 hole of the IBB Golf with the front-line tour
guide, Mr. Maxwell, accompanied by Dr. Ifeanyi
Anya (Special Assistant to the CEO, TAC Africa;
Media and strategy), Mr. Ade (Visual Content
Coordinator), Nneka Ugo, Adaobi Possible and
Mr Sani.

The golf tour was quite exciting as the tour cart
was notably world class standard. We rode on two
(2) different golf cart that took us round the golf.
It took us over 2 hours to tour the about 101
hectares of the IBB Golf Course. Each hole
of the Golf has a T-Box of varying stroke Index.
The starting areas for each hole is designated by
 tee markers and usually distinguished by color.

The School of Hardknocks is making people
attracted to golf for various reasons. It will allow
for some opportunities to enjoy the outdoors and
get a little chance to exercise at the same time.
For others, it is a chance to get away from the
stress and strain of their daily routine and find a
little peace and quiet on the fairways and greens.
Also it will instill and inspire others to join the
social aspect of golf - as a game that people of
different ages, backgrounds, and abilities can play
together. And there is no violence attached to it.

Furthermore, part of the attraction School of
Hardknocks projects through golf, lies in the
friendly competition made possible by keeping
score transparently.

For many, golf is a good way to do business. 

The
long walks and rides between holes of the green
allows plenty of opportunity for businessmen to
make their deals.
According to a manager we interacted with, she
said: “It has given me plenty of hours with clients I
would never have had before. Some even feel that
it is a necessity to play golf well in order to
advance and be accepted in the business world.
As most people associate with the rich and
famous, School of Hardknocks in Nigeria will
certainly change the narrative of golf courses by
extending the values to young kids and beyond. It
will allow those who cannot afford to join the
expensive golf club the opportunity to enjoy the
game and it’s inspirational values. National
statistics shows that over half of the golfers in
Nigeria are prominent and of wealthy
background.
