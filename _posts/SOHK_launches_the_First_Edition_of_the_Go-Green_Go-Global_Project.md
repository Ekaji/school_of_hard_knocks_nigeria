The Go-green Go-global project is an initiative of TAC Africa and is powered by the School of Hardknocks. Our objective is to seamlessly integrate the game of golf with a life skill curriculum, through active learning experiences, thereby building global leaders through our go-green go-global Project.

There is undoubtedly no less expensive way to spend a day, than on a golf course. For a golfer, nothing quite equals the pleasurable sensation of hitting the ball with a well-placed swing and seeing it fly down the fairway onto the green. The peaceful atmosphere, the aroma of the fresh-mowed grass, the manicured landscape, and the company of friends are all pleasant fringe benefits that enhance the business at hand - the pursuit of the perfect swing. This perfectly described the experience the CEO TAC Africa, Dr Jerry Akubo, and the SOHK team had when they visited the IBB Golf Course on Sunday, 5th November 2022. It was indeed a unique and thrilling experience. The entire team went around the eighteen (18) holes of the IBB Golf with the front-line tour guide, Mr. Maxwell, accompanied by Dr. Ifeanyi Anya (Special Assistant to the CEO, TAC Africa; Media and strategy), Mr. Ade (Visual Content Coordinator), Nneka Ugo, Adaobi Possible and Mr. Sani.

The golf tour was quite exciting as the tour carts were notably world-class standard. They rode on two (2) different golf carts that took them around the golf course. It took them over 2 hours to tour the about 101 hectares of the IBB Golf Course. Each hole of the Golf has a T-Box of varying stroke Indexes. The starting areas for each hole are designated by tee markers and distinguished by color.

The School of Hardknocks is endeavoring to get people attracted to golf for various reasons. For some, it will afford them the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors and get a little chance to exercise at the same time. For others, it is a chance to get away from the stress and strain of their daily routine and find a little peace and quiet on the fairways and greens. More so, it will instill and inspire others to join the social aspect of golf - as a game that people of different ages, backgrounds, and abilities can play together. And there is no violence attached to it. Furthermore, part of the attraction School of Hardknocks projects through golf lies in the friendly competition made possible by keeping scores transparently. 

For many, golf is a good way to do business. The long walks and rides between holes of the green allow plenty of opportunities for businessmen to seal their deals. According to a manager we interacted with, she said: â€œIt has given me plenty of hours with clients I would never have had before. Some even feel that it is a necessity to play golf well in order to advance and be accepted in the business world. As most people associate with the rich and famous, the School of Hardknocks in Nigeria will certainly change the narrative of golf courses by extending the values to everyone including kids. It will allow those who cannot afford to join the expensive Golf clubs the opportunity to enjoy the game and its inspirational values. National statistics show that over half of the golfers in Nigeria are prominent and of wealthy backgrounds, but this will not be so at School Of HardKnocks as we aim to include everyone in this project.
