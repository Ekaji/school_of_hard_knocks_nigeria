TAC Africa is Nigeria’s leading Technology driven Anti-Crime Non-Governmental Organization, and currently a fast-acting remedy to recommending solutions to Nigeria’s Insecurity challenges by leveraging new smart technologies to shape the future of Africa’s security architecture and Network. It desires to maintain a front line in sharing Innovative solutions and experiences through technological possibilities and other relevant mechanisms of legal advocacy, research, and talent development in curbing crime beyond any human imagination. 

It was indeed a remarkable day on Saturday, 1st October 2022 at the Tac Community Hub Facility (Centre for Excellence), which is mostly described as the birthplace of Technology in Africa. For many individuals, this venue is best described as heaven on earth with its amazing facilities that inspire and endears a strong life wire to knowledge acquisition through research and relaxation with its unique aesthetic impression from any view.

The Chief Executive Officer/Founder of Technology Against Crime In Africa (TAC Africa) Dr.Jerry Akubo, a very articulate Security expert and Consultant delivered the Keynote lecture, which was themed “Innovative Approach towards Ensuring Sustainable Safety In Nigeria’s Democracy: The Future for kids in Technology."
In his opening speech, the CEO of TAC Africa, Dr. Jerry Akubo dedicated the Independence Day Celebration to the kids by inaugurating the Kids Drone Academy for the future leaders of tomorrow. He further expressed his unbridled Patriotic commitment toward Nation building through Child Development and Innovative Impact leveraging Technology.

Furthermore, the CEO further reiterated his commitment through his Independence Day Speech, that the launch of the Kids Drone Academy is a prerequisite to advancing Child technological Career paths/interests and developing Africa’s Economic and Security space through Research, Digital Specialized Skills, and capacity building for Academia, Law Enforcement Agencies, Government Organizations, and individuals by serving as catalysts through which emerging Technological Solutions could be thought of in a structured and easy-to-learn methodology.

Interestingly, the event was indeed colorful with an array of technological exhibitions with various models of the latest and most sophisticated Drone Cameras to signify the first Inaugural lecture and class of the Kids Drone Academy.

The Head of the Exhibition Team at TAC Africa gave a robust exposition of the various Drone models and their dynamic operations when used for any relevant purposes for which the Drone serves, ranging from Security, Surveillance, Geography, E-mapping, Research, etc. The Kids were no doubt excited and overwhelmed by the sight of the Drone Cameras as they were allowed to touch and understand the physical components of the Drones.

Another kid by the name of Somto expressed, "Today is a remarkable day in my life. On Nigeria’s Independence Day, I am privileged to see a Drone and know its components and its uses. It’s a day I won’t forget in a hurry. 

In his closing remarks, the CEO of TAC Africa announced the news of a five-man Team to be trained on Drone Manufacturing/Maintenance in Canada which is a huge achievement to its objectives and therefore urged the Kids to always be focused and morally upright at all times, as they are the leaders of tomorrow. He admonished members of the Kids Drone Academy to take their studies seriously and count it a great privilege and opportunity to be part of the Inaugural Drone Academy to mark our great Nation's 62nd Independence Day Celebrations. The event came to a close with a specular event at the Tennis Clinic, where the Kids were trained to play Lawn Tennis with a Professional Coach.

This no doubt made the event very interesting for the kids as their mental development was a fundamental concern to the Founder/CEO of TAC Africa, this process will undoubtedly harness their potential and talents in Sporting activities.
The Kids had so much to eat and drink, and they were very excited and happy to participate in the launching of the Kids Drone Academy on Independence Day.
