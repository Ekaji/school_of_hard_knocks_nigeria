It was indeed a remarkable and exciting moment on
Saturday 26 November 2022, receiving the CEO AES
Ti - Long Martial Academy Mr. Adamu . Sada and his
team member Godwin Oturu. Ti-Long is currently
holding titles of the Gold and Silver Medal of the
recent Japanese Shoto karate competition, he also
trains Olympic contestants and has a very articulative passion to inspire confidence in his training
process and kids defence development. The
Strategic meeting was anchored by The Special
Assistant (Media & Strategy TAC) Dr. Ifeanyi Anya, also
in the meeting was Mr. Emmanuel Andor, and Mr.
Ibrahim.
During his Official visit at the TAC Hub he emphasised that Nigeria has a huge surge of interest in judo
and karate due to the prevalence of crime which
includes; Kidnapping, Rape, Abduction an Molestation. The so-called martial arts, like judo and karate,
are another increasingly popular method of defending oneself. These martial arts train a person to use
his hands and body to either injure or kill an
opponent, so, in reality, they, too, are unarmed
weapons.

In some places judo and karate are viewed as just a
‚Äúsport‚Äù that provides healthful exercise. So some
persons who are interested in physical fitness might
feel that such training is comparable to swimming or
general calisthenics. Basically, judo and karate are
methods of unarmed combat that originated in
Japan. As forms of combat or self-defense they are
classed as bushido, which means ‚ÄúThe Way of the
Warrior.‚Äù One encyclopedia pointed out that bushido
‚Äúhad its sources in Buddhism, Shintoism, and Confucianism.‚Äù Ancient Japanese warriors trained in these
techniques so they could bare-handedly fight armed
or unarmed enemies.
According to Ti-Long, ‚ÄúKarate resembles both
jujutsu and judo. But as a purely ‚Äòfighting art‚Äô,
designed to dispose of an enemy in the shortest
possible time with no means barred, I must admit
that it transcends them both in its deadly efficiency.
And why this should be so will appear from the fact
that a single karate technique, if executed in
earnest, is capable of inflicting fatal injury upon its
victim more surely and speedily than either jujutsu
or judo.‚Äù

2) The training should be categorized at different

4) He also pointed out that the Lawn Tennis Court

prestigious schools within Maitama, Asokoro and
Garki to have training sessions at the TAC hub.
