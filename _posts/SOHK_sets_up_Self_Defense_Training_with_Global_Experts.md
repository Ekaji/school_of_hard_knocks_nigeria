It was indeed a remarkable and exciting day on Saturday, 26 November 2022, when we received the CEO of Ti-Long Martial Academy, Mr. Adamu Sada, and his team member, Godwin Oturu. 

### WELCOME VISIT OF TI-LONG TO SOHK NIGERIA	
Ti-Long is currently holding the titles of the Gold and Silver Medal of the recent Japanese Shoto karate competition, he also trains Olympic contestants and has a very articulate passion to inspire confidence in his training process and kids' defense development. This strategic meeting was anchored by the Special Assistant and Media & Strategic Planning of TAC, Dr. Ifeanyi Anya. Also in the meeting were Mr. Emmanuel Andor and Mr. Ibrahim Ali. 
During his official visit to the TAC Hub, he emphasized that Nigeria has a surge of interest in judo and karate due to the prevalence of crime which includes kidnapping, rape, abduction, and molestation. Hence, Martial arts like Judo and Karate, are another increasingly popular method of defending oneself. These martial arts train a person to use his hands and body to either injure or kill an opponent, so, in reality, they, too, are unarmed weapons.

### KARATE AS A SPORT AND AS A SELF-DEFENSE MECHANISM
In some places, Judo and Karate are viewed as just “sport” that provides healthful exercise, so some persons who are interested in physical fitness might feel that such training is comparable to swimming or general calisthenics. Basically, judo and karate are methods of unarmed combat that originated in Japan. As forms of combat or self-defense, they are classed as bushido, which means “The Way of the Warrior.” One encyclopedia pointed out that bushido “had its sources in Buddhism, Shintoism, and Confucianism.” Ancient Japanese warriors trained in these techniques so they could bare-handedly fight armed or unarmed enemies. According to Ti-Long, “Karate resembles both jujutsu and judo. But as a purely ‘fighting art’ designed to dispose of an enemy in the shortest possible time with no means barred, he admitted that it transcends both in its deadly efficiency. And why this should be so will appear from the fact that a single karate technique, if executed in earnest, is capable of inflicting fatal injury upon its victim more surely and speedily than either jujutsu or judo.”

Ti-Long further expressed his overwhelming admiration of the Tac Hub facilities and made some recommendations for the development of the School of Hardknocks which are as follows:
 1. Always be sure of the health status of Participants in the training of Self Defense through a duly signed Medical report.
 2.  The training should be categorized into different sessions to accommodate the disposition of various persons.
3.  As Martial Arts Professionals, participants must have a good measure of enduring skills and resilience. 
4.  He also pointed out that the Lawn Tennis Court could also include Basketball and Badminton Sports. 
5.  The invitation to his training sessions in prestigious schools within Maitama, Asokoro, and Garki to have training sessions at the TAC hub.
